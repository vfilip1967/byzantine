As you know, Byzantine music differs from European music in terms of notes and pitch (frequency they have) in different sounds from the corresponding European ones. This is a difficulty plus the fact that there are no longer many teachers but also capable who can give us what they "heard" from their own teachers. So if you add the fact that Byzantine music by its nature is difficult.
A problem recorded from the time of 1881 and the famous music committee of 1881 with Progakis and Violakis was "the lack of technical means before scientific counting and verification of tonal intervals". Based on this study, the "Psalterion" Byzantine instrument was constructed, which rendered the spaces. Since then there has been the attempt of Kakoulidis with Kripida which did not happen in mass production and the ecclesiastical instrument of Mr. Naoum which is 1 microtonic synthesizer in which the scales of the Byzantine have been passed.
We will take another approach to the subject using the computer and programs and at a very low cost to turn our computer into 1 ecclesiastical "psalter" which renders with mathematical accuracy the spaces and the sounds. In my next posts I will explain how to do it with detailed instructions
